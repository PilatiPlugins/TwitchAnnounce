# TwitchAnnounce
Announce streamers online in minecraft server


**Overview:**
- This plugin is intended to help any server admin to announce the streamers that are live on their server
- Announcement is automatic and timing is set in config file
- Integration with twitch to only announce streamers who are currently live
- Can be configured to advertise only streamers playing on the server or are disconnected from the server but in live
- Priorities can be set to show only the streamers with the highest priority, or to sort the list by priority


**Limitations**
- It's not possible for the plugin to be notified at the exact time the streamer goes live without an external web server, the right combination of unmodifiedInterval and updateInterval settings can work around this issue
